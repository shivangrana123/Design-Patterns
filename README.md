# 🎯 Design Patterns in C#

Hey there 👋

Welcome to my collection of **Design Patterns in C#** – a simple, clean, and practical repo built to help developers (like you and me) understand and apply design patterns in real-world C# projects.

Whether you're brushing up for an interview, trying to write cleaner code, or just love design principles – this is for you.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

This repo covers:

- ✨ Code examples for popular **design patterns** – clean and easy to follow.
- 📚 Quick theory notes & explanations alongside code.
- 🧰 Real-world-inspired demos to show when and why you'd use a pattern.
- 🧪 Unit tests for some patterns (more coming soon!)

No long-winded lectures. Just code and clarity.
