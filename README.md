# 🎯 Design Patterns in C#

Hey there 👋

This repo is for anyone looking to understand **Design Patterns in C#** through clean, simple code examples. I've organized it with clarity in mind — whether you're learning, revising, or trying to apply these patterns in a real project.

You’ll find well-structured implementations, bite-sized theory, and real-world-inspired demos here.

## 🚀 What’s Included?

✅ Hands-on code for each design pattern  
📚 Quick summaries and when-to-use guidance  
🧪 Unit tests and practical usage (where applicable)  
🛠️ Continuous updates (new patterns and examples being added regularly)

## 🔁 Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Strategy | Switch between related algorithms without changing the code that uses them |
| ✅ Command | Encapsulate a request as an object to queue, log, or undo |
| ✅ Null Object | Provide a default “do nothing” behavior instead of null |
| ✅ Specification | Combine business rules and logic into reusable, testable components |
| ✅ State | Change object behavior based on its internal state |
| ✅ Data Access Patterns | Patterns for abstracting data storage and retrieval |
| ✅ Mediator | Coordinate interaction between objects without tight coupling |
| ✅ Chain of Responsibility | Pass requests along a chain of handlers |
| ✅ Template Method | Define the steps of an algorithm, but allow overrides for some |
| ✅ Visitor | Perform operations across a set of objects without changing their structure |
| ✅ Memento | Save and restore object state without violating encapsulation |
| ✅ Rules Engine | Create dynamic, rule-based logic separate from core code |

## 🔨 Creational Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Singleton | Ensure only one instance of a class exists and provide global access |
| ✅ Builder | Construct complex objects step-by-step |
| ✅ Prototype | Clone existing objects without depending on their class |
| ✅ Factory Method | Let subclasses decide which class to instantiate |
| ✅ Abstract Factory | Create families of related objects without specifying their classes |

## 🏗️ Structural Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Facade | Provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem |
| ✅ Decorator | Add behavior to objects at runtime without changing their class |
| ✅ Composite | Treat individual objects and groups of objects the same way |
| ✅ Adapter | Convert one interface into another that clients expect |
| ✅ Flyweight | Use shared objects to support large numbers of similar items efficiently |
| ✅ Proxy | Provide a placeholder to control access to another object |
| ✅ Bridge | Separate abstraction from implementation so they can evolve independently |
